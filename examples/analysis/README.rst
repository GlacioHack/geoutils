Analysis
========

Examples about **numerical operations** on rasters, and **additional features** such as **proximity** or **buffer without overlap** (Voronoi polygons).

Some examples rely on NumPy or pythonic operators on :class:`Rasters<geoutils.Raster>` (see :ref:`core-py-ops` and :ref:`core-array-funcs`).

Others also benefit from match-reference (see :ref:`core-match-ref`).
