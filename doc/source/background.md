More information on the people behind GeoUtils, and the package's mission.

## Mission

```{epigraph}
The core mission of GeoUtils is to be **easy-of-use**, **robust**, **reproducible** and **fully open**.

Additionally, GeoUtils aims to be **efficient**, **scalable** and **state-of-the-art**.
```

In details, those mean:

- **Ease-of-use:** all basic operations or methods only require a few lines of code to be performed;

- **Robustness:** all methods are tested within our continuous integration test-suite, to enforce that they always perform as expected;

- **Reproducibility:** all code is version-controlled and release-based, to ensure consistency of dependent packages and works;

- **Open-source:** all code is accessible and re-usable to anyone in the community, for transparency and open governance.

```{note}
:class: margin
Additional mission points, in particular **scalability**, are partly developed but not a priority until our first long-term release ``v0.1`` is reached.
```

And, additionally:

- **Efficiency**: all methods should be optimized at the lower-level, to function with the highest performance offered by Python packages;

- **Scalability**: all methods should support both lazy processing and distributed parallelized processing, to work with high-resolution data on local machines as well as on HPCs;

- **State-of-the-art**: all methods should be at the cutting edge of remote sensing science, to provide users with the most reliable and up-to-date tools.


## The people behind GeoUtils

```{margin}
<sup>2</sup>More on our GlacioHack founder at [adehecq.github.io](https://adehecq.github.io/)!
```

GeoUtils was created during the [GlacioHack](https://github.com/GlacioHack) hackaton event, that was initiated by
Amaury Dehecq<sup>2</sup> and took place online on November 8, 2020.

<sup>3</sup>Check-out [glaciology.ch](https://glaciology.ch) on our founding group of VAW glaciology!
```

The initial core development of GeoUtils was performed by members of the Glaciology group of the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and
Glaciology (VAW) at ETH ZÃ¼rich<sup>3</sup>, with contributions by members of the University of Oslo, the University of Washington, and University
Grenobles Alpes.

We are not software developers but geoscientists, and we try our best to offer tools that can be useful to a larger group,
documented, reliable and maintained. All development and maintenance is made on a voluntary basis and we welcome
any new contributors. See some information on how to contribute in the dedicated page of our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/GlacioHack/geoutils/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
