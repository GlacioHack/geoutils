## The people behind GeoUtils

<sup>2</sup>More on our GlacioHack founder at [adehecq.github.io](https://adehecq.github.io/)!
```

GeoUtils was created during the [GlacioHack](https://github.com/GlacioHack) hackaton event, that was initiated by
Amaury Dehecq<sup>2</sup> and took place online on November 8, 2020.

```

The initial core development of GeoUtils was performed by members of the Glaciology group of the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and
Glaciology (VAW) at ETH ZÃ¼rich<sup>3</sup>, with contributions by members of the University of Oslo, the University of Washington, and University
Grenobles Alpes.

We are not software developers but geoscientists, and we try our best to offer tools that can be useful to a larger group,
documented, reliable and maintained. All development and maintenance is made on a voluntary basis and we welcome
any new contributors. See some information on how to contribute in the dedicated page of our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/GlacioHack/geoutils/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
