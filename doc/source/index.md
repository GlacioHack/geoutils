# Welcome to GeoUtils' documentation!

```{epigraph}
GeoUtils is an **intuitive**, **robust** and **accessible** package to handle and analyze geospatial data.
```

```{important}
:class: margin
GeoUtils is in early stages of development and its features might evolve rapidly. Note the version you are working on for
**reproducibility**!
We are working on making features fully consistent for the first long-term release ``v0.1`` (likely sometime in 2023).
